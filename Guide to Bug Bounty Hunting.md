# [Guide to Bug Bounty Hunting](https://danialzahoor.blogspot.com/2022/12/guide-to-bug-bounty-hunting.html)

1. **Web Application basics.** Learn how a request works, HTTP headers, JSON requests, how a browser works, how they communicate and send data to the servers, DNS etc. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web

2. **Common scope vulnerabilities.** You will need to know common scope vulnerabilities such as Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Injections (SQL, Command etc.), Clickjacking, Open Redirects, etc.

3. **Read blogs.** Learn new techniques from other bug bounty hunters so that you can test it out during your testing.

4. **Learn how to make and then break.** You need to know how a web or mobile application is developed first so that you can understand how the thing works and hence how it can be broken down. This is beneficial for your long-term development rather than being a hunter that only knows how to send payloads (obtained from internet). Build a few web applications to understand how the web architecture works.
